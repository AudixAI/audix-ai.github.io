By fostering a culture of vigilance, the platform transforms its users into informed "online police officers," promoting security awareness and confidence across the industry.

### Why Whistledown?

#### Up-to-Date Security in Web3

Unlike Web2, where reactive security measures may suffice, Web3 demands a proactive approach. Security can no longer be the sole responsibility of technical experts—it requires the participation of the entire community. Whistledown democratizes security, making it accessible to all and driving greater adoption of Web3 technologies.

#### The Analogy

Imagine moving into a town where neighbors constantly warn you about dangerous areas:

- "Hey Johnny, don’t go to Ox-B Street today; you might get mugged."
    
- "Hey Johnny, avoid Bolton Expressway tomorrow; you might get kidnapped."
    

While well-meaning, these warnings could make you feel unsafe or even drive you to leave the town altogether.

Now, imagine having access to a real-time threat map. You could instantly see which areas are safe and which to avoid, enabling you to explore confidently.

Web3 faces a similar challenge—many perceive it as chaotic and unsafe, deterring users from fully engaging with its potential. Whistledown addresses this by monitoring every corner of the Web3 ecosystem, identifying suspicious activities, and alerting the right people before incidents escalate.

### The Problem

Web3 users currently face several challenges:

1.  Delayed Awareness: Security news often reaches users too late to prevent damage.
    
2.  Limited Reach: Not everyone has access to critical updates, and tracking incidents across multiple channels is impractical.
    
3.  No Historical Records: There is no centralized repository to track and analyze similar attacks or threat patterns.
    

### How Whistledown Works

**1.  Reporting Threats**
- Signed-in users can post updates with:
	- Attack details (e.g., phishing, rug pulls, exploits).
	- Affected projects (protocols, wallets, or platforms).
    - Links to sources or evidence.
- All users can see these updates on the platform, and users subscribed to alerts for all updates are notified immediately.
    

**2.  Tagging and Validation**

- Posts are initially tagged as unverified.
- Validation can be performed by:
	- A validator.
	- 5 regular users (as witnesses).
- Once validated:
	- Alerts are sent to listening users.
	- Related projects' threat history is updated.
- Unvalidated posts are auto-deleted after 48 hours.
    

**3.  Managing False Alarms**  
- Admins tag posts as False Alarm or Defended based on follow-up verification.

**4.  Customizable Alerts**  
- Users can filter updates by project, topic, or severity for noise-free notifications.

**5.  Point System for Contributors**  
- Points are awarded for reporting and validating updates.
- Contributors become eligible for airdrops and Audix benefits.
    

### Security Insights

Users can search and track specific protocols, wallets, or individuals to access a history of validated threats. This feature offers unparalleled visibility into Web3 security trends and patterns.

### Challenges and Solutions

**1.  Preventing Spam Submissions**
- Alerts can be filtered based on project, attack type, or severity.

## AUDIX SECURITY

Audix Security proposes a revolutionary approach to smart contract security, integrating decentralized collaboration and incentivized audits. The platform combines the advantages of private, competitive, and open collaboration models to foster a more efficient and inclusive security ecosystem.

Audix DAO serves as a smart contract security platform, facilitating audits and enabling auditors to collaborate openly. By aligning incentives, the DAO encourages real-time sharing of findings, methodologies, and insights, ensuring that security professionals work together rather than in isolation.

&nbsp;

### Collective Intelligence Mechanisms

#### The Private Audit Paradox

Private audits, while thorough, inherently restrict access to the broader security community's expertise. This limitation echoes Linus’s Law: “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.”

- Insight: Proprietary approaches, like those of private audits, fall short of the collective intelligence achieved through open collaboration.
    
- Lesson from Linux: The open-source model of Linux succeeded by leveraging diverse perspectives, showcasing the benefits of broad community involvement in achieving robust security.
    

#### The Competitive Audit Dilemma

While public competitive audits expand the talent pool, their incentive structures discourage collaboration, as auditors prioritize individual discoveries over collective understanding.

- Impact: Knowledge silos emerge, limiting collective knowledge growth and efficiency.
    
- Hypothesis: An open, collaborative platform will uncover exponentially more vulnerabilities by allowing security professionals to build on one another’s insights and methodologies.
    

### The DAO Solution

Audix DAO bridges these gaps by creating a decentralized collaboration network that aligns incentives and rewards the collective advancement of security knowledge and tools.

&nbsp;

### The New Model Design

#### High-Level Flow

Audix ensures that every audit engagement is handled by the best available security researchers in the World, delivering top-notch results to clients while generating raw data for improving industry tools.

1.  Client submits job → DAO assigns job.
    
2.  DAO selects top researchers for the specific task.
    
3.  Researchers collaborate with the client to ensure optimal service.
    
4.  Researchers provide findings → DAO facilitates reports and feedback for the client and broader community.
    
5.  Researchers’ feedback → Developers → Improved tools.
    

&nbsp;

### Security Researcher Selection Criteria
- Researchers are selected based on their public track record, mainly focusing on recent performances in public audit contests (e.g., Sherlock, Code4rena, Cantina, and Codehawk).
    
- This approach ensures meritocracy, transparency and aligns with Audix's philosophy of openness. It also encourages contest participation, which we believe is a crucial part of Web3 security.
    

### Audit Process

Each engagement involves a team of at least four security researchers, divided into sub-teams for comprehensive analysis.

**1.  Phase I: Competitive Review**  
- Teams compete to identify vulnerabilities.
    
- The winning team receives a larger pro-rata share of the competition pot.
    
**2.  Phase II: Collaborative Review**  
- Teams, DAO representatives, and sponsors validate findings, discuss unresolved leads, and finalize reports for the client and community.

### Stakeholder Compensation

#### Revenue Distribution

- 20–30%: Directed to the DAO treasury to support ecosystem growth and operations.
    
- 70–80%: Distributed among the participating researchers.
    

#### Researcher Payment Structure

- A portion of the pot is divided equally among all participants.
    
- The remaining portion is allocated based on team performance during the competitive phase.
    

Audix Security's innovative model combines the strengths of competition and collaboration, ensuring that every stakeholder—clients, researchers, and the Web3 community—benefits from safer and more secure ecosystems.
